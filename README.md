# SAR Phase Congruency 
SAR-Phase Congruency is an edge detection method designed for SAR images. 

Benefiting from the advantages of phase congruency and ratio-based operators, it can detect both step and roof edges and show robustness to speckle noise.

The source code is provided here in matlab.
